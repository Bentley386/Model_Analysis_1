# Model Analysis 1
Code and reports for the projects done during the Model Analysis 1 course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana.
Most of the code is written for specific problems and needs to be modified for general usage.

### List of Projects
1. Calculus of Variations
2. Linear Programming
3. Non-Linear Minimization
4. Population Models
5. Chemical Reactions
6. Linear Regression
7. Non-Linear Regression
8. Random Number Generators
9. Monte Carlo Simulations
10. Metropolis Algorithm
11. Stochastic Population Models
12. Fourier Analysis
13. Maximum Entropy Method
